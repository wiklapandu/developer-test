# We Don't Bite Developer Test

Howdy, this exercise is in a smaller degree what your daily work at We Don't Bite could be. We hope you find it interesting, and looking forward hearing from you.

## Assignment

Before you start make sure to fork this project into your github account.

### Task 1:
If you open the project file `src/index.html` with your browser you'll see an empty page with a placeholder text. But in the browsers console there two errors we need to fix:

* Something about a missing file?
* A javascript function that is not implemented, see `src/js/main.js`

### Task 2:

Now that we got the errors out of the way is time to start building our website template.

<a href="https://www.figma.com/file/l1LvQtZjx70TkdjKbTeyhU/Toomboo-test?node-id=0%3A1">This</a> is the mockup. You'll find all the images in `src/img`. Bootstrap and jQuery are already included in the html project, so you shouldn't need to add anything else.
Also make sure that the index.html file is a valid html document using the w3c-validator tool: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

#### Nice to have

This is only if you have extra time:
* Make sure it usable on mobile.
* Make the top header 'sticky', so that when you scroll down the page it stays on top.
* Use SCSS if possible
* Clean and structured code is appreciated
* Write meaningful commit message
